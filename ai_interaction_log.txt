You're my Python teacher. I'm supposed to carry out two versions of the same Shopping List Manager in Python 3 for Google Colab.

Both implementations shall have the same behavior but differ in code quality‚Äîone "messy" and one "clean".

Features needed:
1.Add product
2.View all items
3.Delete item
4.Count all items
Very important constraints (Week 1‚Äì3 only):

Only the following are allowed:
Variables (string/int/float/bool)

input()

print()

if/elif/else

while loops

üö´ No: lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples, functions, imports, or file I/O.

Use individual string variables to store items (e.g., slot1 through slot10), with a total capacity of 10.

The program must also handle invalid input gracefully.

I'll be asking you for:

A deliberately messy first draft (messy_shopping.ipynb)

A clean, professional version with the same behavior (clean_shopping.ipynb)

A 300‚Äì500 word code evolution analysis

Short notes on the AI interaction log

Please confirm you understand, then wait for my next message.

Got it! I understand all requirements:

Two Python 3 Colab versions with identical behavior: one messy, one clean.

Features: add product, view all items, delete item, count items.

Strict Week 1‚Äì3 constraints: only variables, input(), print(), if/elif/else, while.

No lists/dicts/sets/tuples, no functions/imports/file I/O.

Use 10 separate string variables (slot1 ‚Ä¶ slot10) as storage.

Must handle invalid input gracefully.

Deliverables: both code versions, a 300‚Äì500 word code evolution analysis, and short AI interaction log notes.

I‚Äôm ready for your next message.

You said:
Create one Python code cell that implements the Shopping List Manager messily but correctly under the restrictions above.

Messy style guidelines (intentionally poor quality but still working):

Use inconsistent, short variable names like a, b1, it2, etc.

Minimal and uneven comments.

Repetition is fine; avoid refactoring.

Rudimentary validation only (e.g., basic numeric checks).

Use a single big while True loop with many if/elif branches.

Store items in variables a1‚Ä¶a10 (empty string means empty slot).

Adding: put new text into the first empty slot; if full, print a simple message.

Viewing: print the non-empty slots in order.

Removing: ask for exact name and clear the first matching slot (case-sensitive).

Counting: count non-empty slots.

Exit option ends the loop.

After the cell, print a short note titled ‚ÄúKnown rough edges‚Äù listing 5‚Äì7 issues (naming, duplication, weak validation, etc.). Do not use any banned features.

Known rough edges

Inconsistent, cryptic variable names (a1‚Ä¶a10, c, k, r, x, z).

Lots of duplicate code instead of reuse/refactoring.

Weak validation (e.g., allows whitespace-y names, no length checks).

Case-sensitive delete; no partial matches or confirmation.

UI is basic; no spacing/alignment or error details.

No prevention of duplicates; can add the same name multiple times.

‚ÄúView‚Äù re-numbers each time and shows nothing about slot positions.

You said:
Rewrite the program in one or two cells with significantly cleaner style but identical user behaviour and restrictions.

Clean style guidelines (while still no functions/lists):

Clear, consistent names: slot1‚Ä¶slot10, menu_choice, is_running, etc.

Header comment explaining purpose, constraints, and capacity (10).

Structured layout: Constants & slots, Main loop, Menu handlers (still inline).

Robust input validation for menu and blank item names.

Helpful, consistent messages and spacing.

Remove by name (first match, case-sensitive) just like messy version.

Safe operations only with Week 1‚Äì3 features.

At the end, include a brief comment block ‚ÄúWhat makes this version cleaner‚Äù listing at least 6 concrete improvements over the messy version.

At least 5 specific differences between messy and clean versions (naming, comments, structure, validation, constants, duplicate logic reduction, menu flow, messages).

Why each change improves readability/maintainability/correctness.

Which version was easier to understand and why.

code_evolution_analysis.txt

This exercise produced two implementations with identical user-visible behavior but very different internal quality. Below are the key differences, why they matter, and reflections on what I learned‚Äîconstrained strictly to Week 1‚Äì3 concepts (variables, input/print, if/elif/else, while).

Naming and intent:
The messy version uses short, inconsistent names (e.g., a1‚Ä¶a10, c, x, z). The clean version adopts descriptive names (slot1‚Ä¶slot10, menu_choice, is_running, added, removed). Clear names reduce cognitive load by revealing purpose directly, which improves readability and prevents logic mistakes when scanning long if/elif chains.

Header comment and documentation:
The clean version begins with a compact header stating purpose, constraints, storage approach, capacity, and behavior. This context lets a reader understand the program before reading any logic. Documentation near the top improves maintainability by making requirements visible and reducing accidental rule violations.

Structured layout:
The clean code is organized into sections‚Äî‚ÄúConstants & Slots,‚Äù ‚ÄúMain loop,‚Äù and inline ‚ÄúMenu handlers.‚Äù This consistent structure makes it easier to locate the relevant part when editing (e.g., changing prompts vs. changing add/delete logic). Even without advanced features, clear segmentation supports quicker debugging.

Input validation rigor:
The messy version does only minimal checks (e.g., empty or single space). The clean version validates menu choices (must be 1‚Äì5) and rejects blank item names, re-prompting until valid. Strong validation improves correctness and user experience, preventing invalid states (like ‚Äúchoice 9‚Äù) from reaching the operation logic.

Constants and single source of truth:
Introducing CAPACITY (informational) documents the limit explicitly. While slots still require individual variables (as per constraints), the constant clarifies intent and keeps messages consistent with the designed capacity, lowering the risk of drift when instructions change.

Duplicate-logic discipline:
Both versions must repeat slot checks (no lists allowed), but the clean version uses consistent ordering and sentinel booleans (added/removed) to make the repetition less error-prone. This preserves identical behavior (first free for add, first match for delete) while improving traceability.

Messages and spacing:
The clean version standardizes prompts, confirmations, and spacing. Consistent phrasing and blank lines improve usability and reduce ambiguity, which makes manual testing more reliable.

Which version is easier to understand and why:
The clean version is easier due to meaningful names, explicit sections, guarded input, and consistent messages. Each block communicates its intent, so the reader spends less time inferring purpose from cryptic labels.

What I learned about good practices:
Even with only basic Week 1‚Äì3 tools, clarity is a design choice: name variables well, state constraints up front, validate inputs, and maintain consistent formatting. Intentional structure and careful repetition can deliver readable, correct programs without relying on advanced features.
